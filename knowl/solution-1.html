If you look at line four carefully you will see that there is no problem with the syntax. So, in this case the next step should be to back up and look at the previous line. In this case if you look at line 2 carefully you will see that there is a missing right parenthesis at the end of the line. Remember that parentheses must be balanced. Since Python allows statements to continue over multiple lines inside parentheses python will continue to scan subsequent lines looking for the balancing right parenthesis. However in this case it finds the name current_time_int and it will want to interpret that as another parameter to the input function. But, there is not a comma to separate the previous string from the variable so as far as Python is concerned the error here is a missing comma. From your perspective its a missing parenthesis. <div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="program"><code class="language-py">current_time_str = input("What is the current time (in hours 0-23)?")
