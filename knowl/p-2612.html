<div class="para">One of the most commonly performed data processing tasks is to read data from a file, manipulate it in some way, and then write the resulting data out to a new data file to be used for other purposes later. To accomplish this, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open</code> function discussed above can also be used to create a new file prepared for writing. Note in <a href="files_introduction-working-with-data-files.html" class="internal" title="Section 11.1: Introduction: Working with Data Files">SectionÂ 11.1</a> that the only difference between opening a file for writing and opening a file for reading is the use of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">'w'</code> flag instead of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">'r'</code> flag as the second parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with that name is created and made ready to accept our data. If an existing file has the same name, its contents are overwritten. As before, the function returns a reference to the new file object.</div>
