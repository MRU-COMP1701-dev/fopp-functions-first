<div class="para">The problem with with global variables is that they can easily lead to unintentional changes that propagate throughout the the entire programs. While it may make sense to change a global variable for one specific function, doing so may mess up the processing for all the other functions. Consider a function that is designed to round and display an assessment’s mark to the nearest whole percentage (78.7% becomes 79%). However, when calculating an overall course grade, we don’t use the individual assignments’ rounded marks, we use their raw, unrounded marks (you don’t ’round’ a ’rounded’ mark). So global changes to individual assessement grades would make the overall course grade incorrect. However, it <em class="emphasis">might</em> make sense to round the overall course grade (changed as a global variable) when that final overall grade is being sent to the Registrar.</div>
