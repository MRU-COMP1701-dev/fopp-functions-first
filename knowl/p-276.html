<div class="para">You’ve run your first program! You’ll be doing that a lot in this book and the programs will become increasingly complicated. One way to help understand what is happening and learn programming is predicting the effect of running a snippet of code before actually running the program. Later on in your development, you may make predictions about large snippets of code, but for now you will typically be predicting the effect of executing a single line of code. A prediction will either be about what gets printed out, or about the value of a variable, or that an error will occur.</div>
