<div class="para">For example, if the problem is to compute the total distance traveled in a series of small trips, you would want to accumulate a sum. If the problem is to make a list of the cubes of all the numbers from 1-25, you want a list accumulation, starting with an empty list and appending one more cube each time. If the problem is to make a comma separated list of all the people invited to a party, you should think of concatenating them; you could start with an empty string and concatenate one more person on each iteration through a list of name.</div>
