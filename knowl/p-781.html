<div class="para">If you give this test case to someone and ask them to test the program, they can type in the inputs, observe the output, check it against the expected output, and determine whether a semantic error exists based on whether the actual output matches the expected output or not. The tester doesn’t even have to know what the program is supposed to do. For this reason, software companies often have separate quality assurance departments whose responsibility is to check that the programs written by the programmers perform as expected. The testers don’t have to be programmers; they just have to be able to operate the program and compare its results with the test cases they’re given.</div>
