<div class="para">There is one other way in Python that code is sometimes documented, by enclosing portions of the text within triple-quotes, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">"""   """</code>. This tells Python that the text should be treated as a <em class="emphasis">string</em> instead of as code to interpret. Strictly speaking, triple-quotes <em class="emphasis">are not comments</em> because the interpreter can still access their contents. In a later chapter we will discuss how this is useful when we document portions of our code (<em class="alert">functions</em>) with (<em class="alert">docstrings</em>). Some programmers take advantage of triple-quoted code not being executed as part of their debugging process: one can essentially ’turn off’ portions of our code without having to delete it, and then turn it ’back on’ by removing the enclosing triple-quotes.</div>
