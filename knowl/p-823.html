<dfn class="terminology">Finding Clues</dfn> How can you help yourself find these problems? One trick that can be very valuable in this situation is to simply start by commenting out the line number that is flagged as having the error. If you comment out line four, the error message now changes to point to line 5. Now you ask yourself, am I really that bad that I have two lines in a row that have errors on them? Maybe, so taken to the extreme, you could comment out all of the remaining lines in the program. Now the error message changes to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">TokenError: EOF in
      multi-line statement</code> This is a very technical way of saying that Python got to the end of file (EOF) while it was still looking for something. In this case a right parenthesis.</div>
