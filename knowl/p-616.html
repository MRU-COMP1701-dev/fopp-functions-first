<div class="para">As you begin programming, you’ll see that there are many ways to solve problems. You’ll also find that one of the thrills of programming is how easily you can do things correctly that humans could easily make errors on. For example, you’ll learn how to write just a very small bit of code to find the 1047th character in a sentence that might be thousands of letters long, and you’ll learn how to do the exact same computation on many different pieces of data.</div>
