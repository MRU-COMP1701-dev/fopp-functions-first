<div class="para">During the initialization of the objects, we created two attributes called x and y for each object, and gave them both the value 0.  You will note that when you run the program, nothing happens.  It turns out that this is not quite the case.  In fact, two <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Points</code> have been created, each having an x and y coordinate with value 0.  However, because we have not asked the program to do anything with the points, we donâ€™t see any other result.</div>
