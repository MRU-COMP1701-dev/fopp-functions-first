<div class="para">When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called <dfn class="terminology">parsing</dfn>. For example, when you hear the sentence, “The other shoe fell”, you understand that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb.  Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means — the <dfn class="terminology">semantics</dfn> of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of this sentence.</div>
