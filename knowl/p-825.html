<dfn class="terminology">Finding Clues</dfn> If you follow the same advice as for the last problem, comment out line one, you will immediately get a different error message. Here’s where you need to be very careful and not panic. The error message you get now is: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">NameError: name
        'current_time_str' is not defined on line 4</code>. You might be very tempted to think that this is somehow related to the earlier problem and immediately conclude that there is something wrong with the variable name <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">current_time_str</code> but if you reflect for a minute you will see that by commenting out line one you have caused a new and unrelated error. That is you have commented out the creation of the name <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">current_time_str</code>. So of course when you want to convert it to an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int</code> you will get the NameError. Yes, this can be confusing, but it will become much easier with experience. It’s also important to keep calm, and evaluate each new clue carefully so you don’t waste time chasing problems that are not really there.</div>
