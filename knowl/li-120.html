<div class="para">Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">2 * (3-1)</code> is 4, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(1+1)**(5-2)</code> is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(minute * 100) / 60</code>: in this case, the parentheses donâ€™t change the result, but they reinforce that the expression in parentheses will be evaluated first.</div>
<div class="para">Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">2**1+1</code> is 3 and not 4, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">3*1**3</code> is 3 and not 27. Can you explain why?</div>
<div class="para">Multiplication and both division operators have the same precedence, which is higher than addition and subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">
                2*3-1</code> yields 5 rather than 4, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">5-2*2</code> is 1, not 6.</div>
<div class="para">Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra we say they are left-associative. So in the expression <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">6-3+2</code>, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3. We then add 2 to get the result 5. If the operations had been evaluated from right to left, the result would have been <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">
                6-(3+2)</code>, which is 1.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="simple-python-data_order-of-operations.html#li-120" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
