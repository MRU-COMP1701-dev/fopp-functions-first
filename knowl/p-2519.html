<div class="para">Earlier when we discussed cloning and aliasing lists we had mentioned that simply cloning a list using [:] would take care of any issues with having two lists unintentionally connected to each other. That was definitely true for making shallow copies (copying a list at the highest level), but as we get into nested data, and nested lists in particular, the rules become a bit more complicated. We can have second-level aliasing in these cases, which means we need to make deep copies.</div>
