<div class="para">Semantic errors are the most dangerous of the three types of errors, because in some cases they are not noticed by either the programmers or the users who use the program. Syntax errors cannot go undetected (the program wonâ€™t run at all if they exist), and runtime errors are usually also obvious and typically detected by developers before a program is released for use (although it is possible for a runtime error to occur for some inputs and not for others, so these can sometimes remain undetected for a while). However, programs often go for years with undetected semantic errors; no one realizes that the program has been producing incorrect results. They just assume that because the results seem reasonable, they are correct. Sometimes, these errors are relatively harmless. But if they involve financial transactions or medical equipment, the results can be harmful or even deadly. For this reason, creating test cases is an important part of the work that programmers perform in order to help them produce programs that work correctly.</div>
