<dfn class="terminology">Finding Clues</dfn> One thing that can help you in this situation is to print out the values and the types of the variables involved in the statement that is causing the error. You might try adding a print statement after line 4 <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">print(x, type(x))</code> You will see that at least we have confirmed that x is of type string. Now you need to start to work backward through the program. You need to ask yourself, where is x used in the program? x is used on lines 2, 3, and of course 5 and 6 (where we are getting an error). So maybe you move the print statement to be after line 2 and again after 3. Line 3 is where you expect the value of x to be changed to an integer. Could line 4 be mysteriously changing x back to a string? Not very likely. So the value and type of x is just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but not after line 3. This helps you isolate the problem to line 3. In fact if you employ one of our earlier techniques of commenting out line 3 you will see that this has no impact on the error, and is a big clue that line 3 as it is currently written is useless.</div>
