<div class="para">Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a <em class="alert">general solution</em>: a solution that can work in (most) circumstances. Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate its execution. Programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer.  A program is written in a <dfn class="terminology">programming language</dfn> such as Python, the language you will learn in this book.</div>
