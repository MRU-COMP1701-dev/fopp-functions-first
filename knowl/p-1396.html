<div class="para">In the above code, we first set amy’s pen color to be “Pink” and then move her forward. Next we want one of two actions to happen, either amy should move right and then forward, or left and then forward. The direction that we want her to go in depends on her pen color. If her pen color is set to pink - which is determined by writing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">amy.pencolor() == "Pink"</code> which checks to see if the value returned by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">amy.pencolor()</code> is the equivalent to the string “Pink” - then we should have her move right and forward. Else (or otherwise) she should move left and forward. Both things can’t happen though. She can’t move right, forward <em class="emphasis">and</em> left, forward. We then do the same thing for kenji, though in this case, we didn’t change kenji’s pen color.</div>
