<div class="para">There is also an option to use an <em class="emphasis">absolute file path</em>. For example, suppose the file structure in the figure is stored on a computer in the user’s home directory, /Users/joebob01/myFiles.  Then code in any Python program running from any file folder could open data2.txt via <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">open('/Users/joebob01/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data2.txt', 'r')</code>. You can tell an absolute file path because it begins with a /. If you will ever move your programs and data to another computer (e.g., to share them with someone else), it will be much more convenient if your use relative file paths rather than absolute. That way, if you preserve the folder structure when moving everything, you won’t need to change your code. If you use absolute paths, then the person you are sharing with probably not have the same home directory name, /Users/joebob01/. Note that Python pathnames follow the UNIX conventions (Mac OS is a UNIX variant), rather than the Windows file pathnames that use : and \. The Python interpreter will translate to Windows pathnames when running on a Windows machine; you should be able to share your Python program between a Windows machine and a MAC without having to rewrite the file open commands.</div>
