<div class="para">In Python, a <dfn class="terminology">function</dfn> is a chunk of code that performs a specific operation that is a meaningful and self-contained part of a larger problem, such as calculating a studentâ€™s GPA in a learning system or responding to the jump action in a video game. Once a function has been defined and you are satisfied that it does what it is supposed to do, it is useful to start thinking about it in terms of the larger operation that it performs rather than the specific lines of code that make it work.</div>
