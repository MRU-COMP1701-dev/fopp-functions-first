<div class="para">Understanding computer programs requires a very step-by-step approach where each step is very specifically expressed. When executed (run), programs are the sequences of actions performed that transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and very fast, but not creatively. <em class="alert">Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you mean for them to do.</em> Thus, understanding computer code involves a lot of mental simulation of what will <em class="emphasis">actually happen</em>, not what you wish would happen.</div>
