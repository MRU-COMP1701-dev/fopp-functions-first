<div class="para">Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, in 2005. He created Git because he was unhappy with the existing version control systems available at the time. He wanted a system that was fast and simple. Git was designed to be a low-level version control system, which means that it is designed to track changes to files, but it did not provide a graphical user interface - however, there are now many GUIs available for Git. Instead, Git provides a command-line interface, which allows users to perform any action that they want. This allows users to create their own workflows and tools that work best for them.</div>
