In this case your biggest clue is to notice the difference in highlighting on the line. Notice that the words “current time” are a different color than those around them. Why is this? Because “current time” is in double quotes inside another pair of double quotes Python thinks that you are finishing off one string, then you have some other names and finally another string. But you haven’t separated these names or strings by commas, and you haven’t added them together with the concatenation operator (+). So, there are several corrections you could make. First you could make the argument to input be as follows: "What is the ’current time’ (in hours 0-23) " Notice that here we have correctly used single quotes inside double quotes . Another option is to simply remove the extra double quotes. Why were you quoting “current time” anyway?
