<div class="para">With semantic errors, the problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. The computer is faithfully carrying out the instructions you wrote, and its results are correct, given the instructions that you provided. However, because your instructions have a flaw in their design, the program does not behave as desired.</div>
