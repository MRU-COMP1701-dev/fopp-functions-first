<div class="para">In the code above, we iterated through <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">range(len(colors))</code> because it made it easier to locate the position of the item in the list and delete it. However, we run into a problem because as we delete content from the list, the list becomes shorter. Not only do we have an issue indexing on line 4 after a certain point, but we also skip over some strings because theyâ€™ve been moved around. To see this more easily, try walking through this code in codelens. Note that each time we iterate through the list python does not reevaluate the iterator variable.</div>
