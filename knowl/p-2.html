<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This "Functions First" edition is an adaptation of the original Foundations of Python Programming book that places an emphasis on learning to <em class="emphasis">program</em>, not learning to program <em class="emphasis">in Python</em>. This book was created for Mount Royal Universityâ€™s introductory programming course, where students learn Python first and then follow up with C++ or Java depending on their major. The following changes were made:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">As suggested by the name, functions were moved much earlier in the book and are introduced as the major programming construct. We have observed that functions are one of the most challenging concept for beginners, so the early introduction provides the opportunity to practice this concept throughout the course.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Most turtle graphics examples were removed to keep the focus on terminal programs.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Python-specific data structures and patterns like dictionaries, list comprehension, tuple packing and unpacking were removed to maintain a focus on the core programming concepts.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Iteration was rearranged to introduce <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code> before <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loops in order to emphasize the initialization, condition, update pattern.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Several chapters such as sorting, testing, and inheritance were removed to keep the content consistent with a single semester course.</div></li>
