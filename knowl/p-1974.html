<div class="para">The first method we’ll talk about is called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">count</code>. It requires that you provide one argument, which is what you would like to count. The method then returns the number of times that the argument occured in the string/list the method was used on. There are some differences between count for strings and count for lists. When you use count on a string, the argument can only be a string. You can’t count how many times the integer 2 appears in a string, though you can count how many times the string “2” appears in a string. For lists, the argument is not restricted to just strings.</div>
