<div class="para">This is just our old friend, the accumulation pattern, adding each additional output to the sum-so-far, which is stored in a variable called theSum and reassigned to that variable on each iteration. Notice that theSum is initialized to 0. Also notice that we had to initialize x, our variable that stores each input that the user types, before the while loop. This is typical with while loops, and makes them a little tricky to read and write. We had to initialize it because the condition <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x != 0</code> is checked at the very beginning, before the code block is ever executed. In this case, we picked an initial value that we knew would make the condition true, to ensure that the while loopâ€™s code block would execute at least once.</div>
