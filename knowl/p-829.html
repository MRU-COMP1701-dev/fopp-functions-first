<div class="para">In finding this error there are few lessons to think about. First, you may find it very disconcerting that you cannot understand the whole program. Unless you speak Polish then this wonâ€™t be an issue. But, learning what you can ignore, and what you need to focus on is a very important part of the debugging process. Second, types and good variable names are important and can be very helpful. In this case a and x are not particularly helpful names, and in particular they do not help you think about the types of your variables, which as the error message implies is the root of the problem here. The rest of the lessons we will get back to in a minute.</div>
