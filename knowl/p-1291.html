<div class="para">Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order, from top to bottom. Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside a function are not executed until the function is called. Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps into the scope of that called function, to the functionâ€™s first line, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.</div>
