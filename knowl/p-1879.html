<div class="para">Why does counting start at 0 going from left to right, but at -1 going from right to left? Well, indexing starting at 0 has a long history in computer science having to do with some low-level implementation details that we won’t go into. For indexing from right to left, it might seem natural to do the analgous thing and start at -0. Unfortunately, -0 is the same as 0, so s[-0] can’t be the last item. Remember we said that programming languages are formal languages where details matter and everything is taken literally?</div>
