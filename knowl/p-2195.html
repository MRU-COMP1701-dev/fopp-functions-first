<div class="para">This might be difficult to understand since these two lists appear to be the same. In Python, every object has a unique identification tag. Likewise, there is a built-in function that can be called on any object to return its unique id. The function is appropriately called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">id</code> and takes a single parameter, the object that you are interested in knowing about. You can see in the example below that a real id is usually a very large integer value (corresponding to an address in memory). In the textbook though the number will likely be smaller.</div>
