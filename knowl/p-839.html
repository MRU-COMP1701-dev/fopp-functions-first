<div class="para">1. The word you are searching for will appear only once in your code, it’s also likely that it will be on the right hand side of an assignment statement, or as a parameter to a function. That should confirm for you that you have a typo somewhere. If the name in question <dfn class="terminology">is</dfn> what you thought it should be then you probably have a typo on the left hand side of an assignment statement on a line before your error message occurs. Start looking backward at your assignment statements. In some cases it’s really nice to leave all the highlighted strings from the search function visible as they will help you very quickly find a line where you might have expected your variable to be highlighted.</div>
