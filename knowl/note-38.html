<div class="para">Introduction of the while statement causes us to think about the types of iteration we have seen. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> statement will always iterate through a sequence of values like the list of names for the party or the list of numbers created by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">range</code>. Since we know that it will iterate once for each value in the collection, it is often said that a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loop creates a <dfn class="terminology">definite iteration</dfn> because we definitely know how many times we are going to iterate.  On the other hand, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code> statement is dependent on a condition that needs to evaluate to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">False</code> in order for the loop to terminate. Since we do not necessarily know when this will happen, it creates what we call <dfn class="terminology">indefinite iteration</dfn>. Indefinite iteration simply means that we donâ€™t know how many times we will repeat but eventually the condition controlling the iteration will fail and the iteration will stop. (Unless we have an infinite loop which is of course a problem)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="more-about-iteration_the-while-statement.html#note-38" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
