<div class="para">Some of the typical operations that one associates with points might be to ask the point for its x coordinate, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">getX</code>, or to ask for its y coordinate, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">getY</code>.  You would want these types of functions available to prevent accidental changes to these instance variables since doing so would allow you to view the values without accessing them directly.  You may also wish to calculate the distance of a point from the origin, or the distance of a point from another point, or find the midpoint between two points, or answer the question as to whether a point falls within a given rectangle or circle.  Weâ€™ll shortly see how we can organize these together with the data.</div>
