<div class="para">As you can infer from the name high-level language, there are also <dfn class="terminology">low-level languages</dfn>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, low-level languages use numerical codes or symbols to tell the computer how to process and move data. Generally, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.</div>
