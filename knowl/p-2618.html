<div class="para">Once the file has been created, we just need to call the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">write</code> method passing the string that we wish to add to the file. In this case, the string is already being printed so we will just change the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">print</code> into a call to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">write</code> method. However, there is an additional step to take, since the write method can only accept a string as input. Weâ€™ll need to convert the number to a string. Then, we just need to add one extra character to the string. The newline character needs to be concatenated to the end of the line. The entire line now becomes <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">outfile.write(str(square)+ '\n')</code>. The print statement automatically outputs a newline character after whatever text it outputs, but the write method does not do that automatically. We also need to close the file when we are done.</div>
