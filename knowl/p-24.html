<div class="para">Today, the amount of computing power and the volume of data available to us is staggering.  The field of machine learning is just beginning to harness this power and data and is transforming the field of computer science.  At one level, machine learning, allows programs to do for themselves what programmers have had to do for years, which is to recognize complex patterns in the data. Machine learning algorithms are now routinely doing better than humans in tasks like reading X-rays, or recommending a restaurant to try.</div>
