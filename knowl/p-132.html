<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">program</dfn> is an algorithm expressed in a programming language. We might also say that a program is an <em class="emphasis">implementation</em> of an algorithm. In this example, both the algorithm and the program have three major steps. The first step gets some input from the user and the input into something the computer can do math with; the second step performs a calculation using the information obtained in the first step; and the final step displays the result to the user. Even though we havenâ€™t covered any details of Python, hopefully you can see the correspondence between the steps of the algorithm, which could be followed by a human (but not executed by a computer), and the steps of the program, which can be executed by a computer (try executing this one using the Run button).</div>
