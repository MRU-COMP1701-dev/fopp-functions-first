<div class="para">Notice that this algorithm consists of a set of steps. It is written in English, for ease of understanding but that it assumes the reader knows the required sub-steps. Although simple algorithms are easily understood when written in English, more complicated algorithms need more precise notation. For improved precision, algorithms are often written in pseudocode. <dfn class="terminology">Pseudocode</dfn> is a notation that is more precise than English but generally not as precise as a programming language. The same algorithm expressed in pseudocode might look something like this:</div>
