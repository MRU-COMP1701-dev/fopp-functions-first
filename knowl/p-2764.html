<dfn class="terminology">What is the data that you want to deal with?</dfn> (Data about a bunch of songs from iTunes? Data about a bunch of tweets from Twitter? Data about a bunch of hashtag searches on Twitter? Two numbers that represent coordinates of a point on a 2-dimensional plane?)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">What will one instance of your class represent?</dfn> In other words, which sort of new <em class="emphasis">thing</em> in your program should have fancy functionality? One song? One hashtag? One tweet? One point? The answer to this question should help you decide what to call the class you define.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">What information should each instance have as instance variables?</dfn> This is related to what an instance represents. See if you can make it into a sentence. <em class="emphasis">“Each instance represents one &lt; song &gt; and each &lt; song &gt; has an &lt; artist &gt; and a &lt; title &gt; as instance variables.”</em> Or, <em class="emphasis">“Each instance represents a &lt; Tweet &gt; and each &lt; Tweet &gt; has a &lt; user (who posted it) &gt; and &lt; a message content string &gt; as instance variables.”</em>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">What instance methods should each instance have?</dfn> What should each instance be able to <em class="emphasis">do</em>? To continue using the same examples: Maybe each song has a method that uses a lyrics API to get a long string of its lyrics. Maybe each song has a method that returns a string of its artist’s name. Or for a tweet, maybe each tweet has a method that returns the length of the tweet’s message. (Go wild!)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">What should the printed version of an instance look like?</dfn> (This question will help you determine how to write the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">__str__</code> method.) Maybe, “Each song printed out will show the song title and the artist’s name.” or “Each Tweet printed out will show the username of the person who posted it and the message content of the tweet.”</div></li>
