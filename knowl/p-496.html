<div class="para">If you have programmed in another language such as Java or C++, you may be used to the idea that <em class="emphasis">variables</em> have types that are declared when the variable name is first introduced in a program. Python doesn’t do that. Variables don’t have types in Python; <em class="emphasis">values</em> do. That means that it is acceptable in Python to have a variable name refer to an integer and later have the same variable name refer to a string. This is almost never a good idea, because it will confuse human readers (including you), but the Python interpreter will not complain.</div>
